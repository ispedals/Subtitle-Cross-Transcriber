#Subtitle Cross-Transcriber

This was an attempt to make a single page app for transcribing a video using the timings from a translated ass-formatted subtitle.
This also had some features specific to transcribing Japanese such as automatically generating the reading of kanji in a line.
The code is very messy and needs to be rewritten. This and especially the files prefixed with OLD_ are for reference. Maybe one day I'll come back to this.
